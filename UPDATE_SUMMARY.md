## Updates & Fixes Performed

### 1. **Project Structure & Essential Files**
- Copied and adapted all essential files from the working MVP app:
  - `App.js` (now wraps app in `AuthProvider` and `TransactionProvider`)
  - `app.json`, `package.json`, `index.js`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`
- Ensured Expo configuration and scripts are correct for development and testing.

### 2. **Contexts & Providers**
- Migrated `contexts/AuthContext.js` and `contexts/TransactionContext.js` to support authentication and transaction state across the app.
- Fixed context provider wrapping in `App.js` to resolve context errors (e.g., `isAuthenticated` undefined).

### 3. **Screens & Navigation**
- Copied all required screens from the MVP app:
  - `LoginScreen.js`, `SignUpScreen.js`, `DepositScreen.js`, `WithdrawScreen.js`, `PayInStoreScreen.js`, `ProfileSettingsScreen.js`, `ReceiveMoneyScreen.js`, `SendMoneyScreen.js`
- Fixed missing or duplicate exports (e.g., duplicate `export default` in `SendMoneyScreen.js`).
- Ensured all navigation and screen imports resolve correctly.

### 4. **Assets & Dependencies**
- Ensured the `assets/` folder is present and referenced correctly in `app.json`.
- Installed missing dependencies (e.g., `expo-clipboard`).
- Verified all required packages are listed in `package.json`.

### 5. **General Fixes**
- Removed duplicate code and resolved syntax errors.
- Addressed missing module and asset errors during Expo bundling.
- Confirmed the app now runs in Expo Go and is ready for further review.
