# UI Alternatives Comparison for Action Buttons

This document compares the different UI patterns implemented for the "Add", "Send", "Receive", and "Withdraw" buttons in the BalanceCard.

## 1. Bottom Sheet (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Consistent sizing, familiar pattern, good for mobile, smooth animations
- **Cons**: Limited space for complex options
- **Best For**: Simple action selection with consistent modal sizing
- **Visual**: Bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom

## 2. Floating Action Menu
- **Pros**: Modern FAB design, space-efficient, smooth spring animations
- **Cons**: Limited space for detailed options, may feel cramped
- **Best For**: Quick actions with minimal information
- **Visual**: Floating action button that expands to show action buttons in a cross pattern

## 3. Slide Out Panel
- **Pros**: Side panel design, good for longer lists, familiar navigation pattern
- **Cons**: Takes up horizontal space, may feel less mobile-optimized
- **Best For**: When you have many options that need to be browsed
- **Visual**: Panel that slides in from the right side

## 4. Inline Expandable Cards
- **Pros**: Clean card-based design, expandable options, good information hierarchy
- **Cons**: Takes up more vertical space, requires scrolling for all options
- **Best For**: When you want to show detailed information for each option
- **Visual**: Cards that expand in place to reveal sub-options

## 5. Tabbed Interface
- **Pros**: Organized by action type, consistent sizing, smooth tab transitions, excellent information density
- **Cons**: Requires tab switching to see all options
- **Best For**: When you have many options that can be logically grouped
- **Visual**: Tabbed modal with 4 tabs (Add, Send, Receive, Withdraw), each showing a grid of options

## 6. Overlay Cards with Consistent Sizing
- **Pros**: Consistent card sizes, overlay design, good visual hierarchy, two-step navigation, fee information
- **Cons**: Requires two taps to reach payment methods
- **Best For**: When you want to maintain consistent visual sizing and show fee information
- **Visual**: Overlay cards with uniform dimensions, two-step navigation (action → methods)
