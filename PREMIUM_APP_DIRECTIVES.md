## I. Core Principles for Development

1. **User-Centric Design (UX):**
    - **Intuitive Flows:** Every interaction, from onboarding to complex transactions, must be seamless and logical. Minimize taps and cognitive load.
    - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language (colors, fonts, spacing, icon styles) across all screens.
    - **Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear visual/haptic feedback for every user action (e.g., button presses, successful operations, errors).
    - **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is usable by a wide range of users, considering contrast, font sizes, and screen reader compatibility.

2. **Performance & Responsiveness:**
    - **Blazing Fast:** Loading times (as seen in your app's "Loading App..." screen, 0:20-0:21) must be minimal. Optimize asset loading, network requests, and rendering performance.
    - **Smooth Animations:** Transitions between screens and UI element changes (e.g., expanding sections, tab switches) should be fluid, not jerky. This is a hallmark of premium apps (evident in Revolut's smooth scrolling and navigation).
    - **Offline Capability (Partial):** For non-critical data, consider caching to allow some functionality even without an internet connection.

3. **Security & Trust:**
    - **Robust Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometric login (Face ID/Fingerprint), and secure session management.
    - **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, must be encrypted.
    - **Clear Security Messaging:** Inform users about security features and practices without causing alarm (e.g., "This screen is hidden to protect your personal data" in Revolut).
